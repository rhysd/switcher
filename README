NAME
	switcher

SYNOPSIS
	switcher command [options]

DESCRIPTION
	This is Ruby script for dealing with multiple version as the same binary name.
	Like rvm, but you can define group by yourself.

COMMANDS
	list [group]
		You can watch the group information. (what version does each group have?)
		If you specify group, you can watch versions in specific group.

	use {group} {version}
		Switcher sets PATH to {version} of {group}.
		If you specify system for {version}, switcher use system default setting.

	current
		Switcher show what version of group is currently using.

	reset
		Switcher sets all versions to system.

EXAMPLE
	example setting:

		groupname: ruby
		* version: 1.8.7
		ruby => /usr/bin/ruby
		rdoc => /usr/bin/rdoc
		rake => /usr/bin/rake
		irb  => /usr/bin/irb
		ri   => /usr/bin/ri
		gem  => /usr/bin/gem

		* version: 1.9.3
		ruby => /usr/local/bin/ruby
		rdoc => /usr/local/bin/rdoc
		rake => /usr/local/bin/rake
		irb  => /usr/local/bin/irb
		ri   => /usr/local/bin/ri
		gem  => /usr/local/bin/gem

	example commands:

		% switcher list
		=> displays above list

		%switcher use ruby 1.9.3
		=> paths of ruby,rdoc,rake,irb,ri,gem set to binary for Ruby 1.9.3.

		"switcher current"
		=> show version. (for example, 1.9.3)

BOOTSTRAP
	You must set and define some information manually.

	1. put switcher to anywhere in your path.

	2. edit source code of switcher

		2-1. At first, you define $switcher_path at line 4. (default is /usr/local/bin. and setting for $HOME is commentouted)

		2-2. Secondly, you define groups and versions of them.
		     There are gcc group and Ruby group for example.
			 And snippet of definition of group is commentouted.

    3. set path of "${switcher_path}/switcher.d" to head of $PATH.
       write to your .bashrc / .zshrc like below.
       
            export PATH=/usr/local/bin/switcher.d:$PATH (this is example: $switcher_path = /usr/local/bin)

	4. you've finished needed settings. But you must recreate hash of shell after
	   you change to another version of group with use command.
			
			% rehash  (in zsh)
			% hash -r (in bash)

	   If you recreate hash automatically, set below.

		4-1. for bash
			You use switcher.sh instead of switcher.

		4-2. for zsh
			You write below setting to .zshrc

			# switcher setting

			function switcher(){
				/path/to/switcher $*
				if [ "$1" = "use" ]; then
					echo "rehash shell database"
					rehash
				fi
			}
